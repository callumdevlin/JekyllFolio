title: RFID Tool Storage
---
The inspiration for my 4th-year project came from a challenge I frequently encounter: managing tools efficiently. Whether during my workday at a Van Conversion company or in my own workspace, I’ve noticed how much time and effort can be wasted searching for misplaced tools in cluttered or poorly designed storage systems. In fact, studies show that up to 47% of workers’ time can be spent simply locating tools.

This project aims to tackle that problem by designing an innovative tool storage solution. My goal is to create a system that not only organizes tools effectively but also improves accessibility and minimizes downtime, offering a practical solution for professionals and hobbyists alike.

This project is currently underway and will be updated until May 2025 when it is finished.
