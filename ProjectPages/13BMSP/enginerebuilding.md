#My Rebuild Journey

## Why I’m Rebuilding My 13B-MSP
After years of wanting enjoying the unique performance of the 13B-MSP, I discovered a serious issue that made a rebuild inevitable. The rear stationary gear bearing had spun due to oil starvation, causing damage to the eccentric shaft and leaving it scored and unusable. This kind of damage isn’t something you can ignore, it compromises the engine's functionality and risks further damage if left unaddressed.

Given the extent of the damage, I decided to embark on a full rebuild. My goal is not just to fix the immediate problem but to take this opportunity to enhance the engine's longevity and performance. As part of the rebuild, I’ll be replacing all the seals (apex, side, and oil control seals), ensuring the internal components are in top condition, and making any necessary upgrades to improve reliability and quality.

This rebuild is more than just a repair, it’s a chance to breathe new life into the engine, ensuring it revs strong for years to come.
