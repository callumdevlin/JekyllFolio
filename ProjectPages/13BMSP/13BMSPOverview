## Introduction
#### What is the 13B-MSP Engine?

The 13B-MSP engine, also known as the Renesis, is the unique rotary engine that powers the Mazda RX-8. Unlike traditional piston engines, the 13B-MSP uses a rotary design with triangular rotors instead of pistons. This innovative approach allows for smoother operation, high-revving performance, and a compact engine size, making it a standout feature of the RX-8. 
What sets the Renesis apart is its improved efficiency and emissions compared to earlier rotary engines. It achieves this by relocating the exhaust ports to the side housings, reducing overlap between intake and exhaust cycles. This results in a more refined engine that still delivers the exhilarating experience rotary fans love.
I’ve spent countless hours working with this engine, learning its quirks, strengths, and challenges. It’s a fascinating piece of engineering, but like any high-performance engine, it requires attention and care.

#### Why I Created This Page

I created this page to document my experiences rebuilding the 13B-MSP engine, share the knowledge I’ve gained, and help others who may be working on their own projects.
Whether you’re an RX-8 owner troubleshooting issues, a rotary enthusiast curious about the engine, or someone considering a rebuild, I hope this guide offers valuable insights.
